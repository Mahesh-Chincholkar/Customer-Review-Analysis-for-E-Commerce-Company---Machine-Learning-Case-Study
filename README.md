# Data Preprocessing
The dataset undergoes preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for analysis. Steps include:

-Handling missing values by imputing or dropping them based on context.
-Encoding categorical variables to numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.
-Text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatization.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand patterns in the data. Tasks include:

-Visualizing distributions of ratings, sentiments, and other relevant features.
-Analyzing trends by channel, location, category, subcategories, and age group.
-Exploring correlations between customer demographics and review sentiments.

# Text Mining
Text mining techniques are used to extract insights from customer reviews. Tasks include:

-Creating word clouds and frequency plots for positive and negative reviews.
-Analyzing sentiment among customers for different categories, subcategories, and locations.
-Performing topic mining using algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover themes behind topics.

# Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics models are built to understand drivers of customer recommendations and predict review ratings. Tasks include:

-Building classification models to predict which customers are recommending products.
-Predicting review ratings based on the review text using algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

# Conclusion
This project aims to analyze customer reviews for a leading woman clothing e-commerce company. By preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory analysis, text mining, and predictive analytics, the project aims to provide insights into customer behavior, sentiment, and preferences. These insights can help the company enhance its understanding of the target market, improve products and services, and tailor marketing strategies to better meet customer needs.
